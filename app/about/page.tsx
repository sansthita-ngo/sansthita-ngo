              The Night That Started Sansthita
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In the year 2000, it was an ordinary night in Kalindi Housing
              Estate. Residents were preparing to go to bed just like any other
              day. Suddenly, everything changed.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              A heartbreaking scene unfolded before the community — a woman and
              her two young children were being cruelly forced out of their home
              by her husband and his relatives, left helpless in the darkness of
              the night.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              That night, humanity stood up for her. The residents of the
              community came together and stood firmly by her side. With the
              help of local residents and the police, the mother and her
              children were eventually able to return to their home and find
              shelter.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              What followed was a long struggle to restore her rights and
              dignity. The fight continued for nearly five years as the
              community continued to support her.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              During this difficult time, IPS Officer{" "}
              <strong>Ms. Bharati Ghosh</strong> of Bhawani Bhavan encouraged
              the residents to form an organization that could support many more
              oppressed women facing similar situations.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Inspired by this guidance, the community came together to create
              an organization dedicated to justice and dignity. In 2005, that
              vision became reality when <strong>Sansthita</strong> was
              officially registered as a human rights organization.
